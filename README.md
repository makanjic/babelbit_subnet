# BabelBit

## What is Babelbit?
### Background Theory
Babelbit is a subnet which is developing low-latency speech-to-speech translation. We are working on the principle that as well as all the latency which is caused by speech encoding and synthesis, there have traditionally been hard limits on the latency of translating the language itself. That is, it is often not clear what a sentence means until you have the whole thing. This is especially true with languages where the word order rules put the verb at the end of a clause, like German, or sometimes the end of a sentence, in dialects like this example in Swiss German:

*Ich ha s Schlos, wo ich, wie so oft, z'heftig, i mim Stress, wo wider mau passiert isch, verdräit ha, ufbroche.*

which means:

*I broke the lock, turning it too hard, in my usual panic*

but is articulated something like:

*I have, the lock, which I, as so often, too forcefully, in my panic, again, turned have, broken.*

That is, **the listener has no idea what the sentence is about (breaking a lock) until the very last word**. 

### Our Hypothesis
When native speakers listen to sentences with the verb at the end, in the vast majority of cases, they know what it will be. LLMs work in exactly the same way. In fact the fundamental mechanism by which they appear to exhibit intelligence is in predicting the best possible word to come next given the prior context. We are going to stretch this predictive power to its absolute limits, so that we can guess from the context what speaker is about to say, and start translating earlier. 

## Our First Challenge
- it doesn't involve speech
- it doesn't involve translation
- **What????**

Our first job is to develop the prediction technique. So the challenge involves predicting not just the next word, but the entire phrase or sentence, and predicting it again, each time a word is revealed.

What's more, **the best answer might not have all the words right**

Remember that our predictions are part of a translation system. So if your script makes a prediction which *means* the same as the input, it can score very highly. Translating a sentence which means the same as what was said is just as good as translating the original, especially if it can be output much more quickly, e.g. 

INPUT: Hi - how is all going with you?

REVEALED PART OF THE INPUT: Hi - how....

PREDICTION: Hi - how are you?

Would it matter if we translated "how are you?" instead of "how is all going with you?"

So first we must master the art of making predictions which are similar, whether that is *lexically* or *semantically* similar. If we can get a semantically adequate prediction *much* earlier than we could if we waited for the whole input, we can reduce translation latency by a huge degree. 

You can improve our script; improve our model; replace the model with your own better one; retrain a new open-source model you just heard about. 

Knock yourselves out. This is a creative field, in which the winners will be making a gigantic contribution to technology. 

We have just added **one million utterances** of test data in a free repository:

https://github.com/babelbit/miner-test-data

This is all formatted to work with the test tools, and uses the same JSON schema as the validation data. 


# Setup 
## Bittensor
Get a Bittensor wallet

### Install bittensor cli
```bash
pip install bittensor-cli
```

### Create a coldkey (your main wallet)
```bash
btcli wallet new_coldkey --n_words 24 --wallet.name my-wallet
```

### Create a hotkey (for signing transactions)

```bash
btcli wallet new_hotkey --wallet.name my-wallet --n_words 24 --wallet.hotkey my-hotkey
```

### Update your .env file
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
BITTENSOR_WALLET_COLD=coldkey
BITTENSOR_WALLET_HOT=my-hotkey
# Path to your hotkey file
BITTENSOR_WALLET_PATH=~/.bittensor/wallets/my-wallet/hotkeys/my-hotkey
EOF
```
If you are using a different subnet or a local subtensor, also set:
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
# Subnet and subtensor configuration
BABELBIT_NETUID=59
BITTENSOR_SUBTENSOR_ENDPOINT=finney
BITTENSOR_SUBTENSOR_FALLBACK=wss://lite.sub.latent.to:443
EOF
```

## Chutes 

### Install chutes cli
`pip install -U chutes`

### Register your account
`chutes register`

Follow the interactive prompts to:

- Enter your desired username
- Select your Bittensor wallet
- Choose your hotkey
- Complete the registration process (note your unique fingerprint)

### Create an API key
- Log into chutes website (via your fingerprint)
- Create an API token 

### Update your .env file
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
CHUTES_USERNAME=your-username
CHUTES_API_KEY=your-api-key
EOF
```

## Huggingface
- Create a Huggingface account and sign in
- Create a token

### Update your .env file
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME=your-username
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-api-key
EOF
```

# Validators

## S3 Bucket (optional)

Logs created by the validator can be stored in a S3 bucket for later use. This step is optional and won't affect the output of the validator.

### Update your .env file if using S3
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
BB_ENABLE_S3_UPLOADS=1
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=your-s3-endpoint-url
S3_REGION=s3-region
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-s3-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-s3-secret
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket
S3_SUBMISSIONS_DIR=challenges
S3_LOG_DIR=logs
S3_ADDRESSING_STYLE=s3-addressing-style-used-by-your-cloud-provider
S3_SIGNATURE_VERSION=s3-signature-version
S3_USE_SSL=true-or-false
EOF
```
`S3_SUBMISSIONS_DIR` is the challenges directory prefix (older docs used `S3_CHALLENGES_DIR`).

## Validator/Runner Endpoints

The validator and runner call out to external services. You can override these defaults if needed.

### Update your .env file
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
BB_UTTERANCE_ENGINE_URL=https://api.babelbit.ai
BB_SUBMIT_API_URL=https://scoring.babelbit.ai
EOF
```

## Local setup (non-docker)
If you plan to run the validator/runner/signer or the self-hosted miner locally, install the CLI and deps once:
```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# setup
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync  # install deps

# verify installation
bb
```

## Running the validator

(Recommended): Run the validator with docker.
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose pull 
docker compose up --build -d && docker compose logs -f
```

(Optional): Run the validator locally
Local runs require a reachable signer service. The default `SIGNER_URL` is
`http://signer:8080` (docker-only), so set it to your local signer first:
```bash
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
SIGNER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
# Optional: override signer bind/port if needed
# SIGNER_HOST=127.0.0.1
# SIGNER_PORT=8080
EOF
```
```bash
bb -vv validate
bb -vv runner
bb -vv signer
```

# Miners

**Two options for running a miner:**
1. **Chutes-hosted** (recommended for production): Deploy your model to Chutes cloud infrastructure
2. **Self-hosted** (for development/testing): Run the miner API directly on your own hardware

## Option 1: Chutes-Hosted Miner (Production)

**IMPORTANT: Please follow the instructions below carefully to ensure the proper commitment of your chute.**

<u>Note 1</u>: Using the CLI will help create the proper Chutes slug for your image and therefore avoid any issue during validation. Chutes slugs should contain the substring 'Babelbit'. Use the chute CLI directly at your own risk.

<u>Note 2</u>: You need to register your miner with the **same hotkey** linked to your Chutes account. This ensures that the validators are granted access to your Chute.

0. Install Babelbit CLI (uv)

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# setup
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync  # install deps

# verify installation
bb
```

1. Register with the Subnet 
Register your miner to BabelBit (SN59).
```bash
btcli subnet register --wallet.name <your cold> --wallet.hotkey <your hot> --netuid 59
```

2. Upgrade Chutes to a Developer-Enable Account
Miners need a chutes developer account ( `chutes.ai` ). 

IMPORTANT: you require a ***developer enabled account*** on Chutes to mine. Normal API keys cannot deploy chutes right now.

3. Train a model
```bash
... magic ML stuff ...
```

4. Modify how the model will be deployed on Chutes
Before you push your model, you can customise how it is loaded in on chutes and handles predictions

- `babelbit/chute_template/setup.py`
- `babelbit/chute_template/load.py`
- `babelbit/chute_template/predict.py`

It is highly recommended to build the chute locally after any changes to check for errors. Steps to build locally:
- (optional) ssh onto a machine with the specs matching your requirements (e.g. GPU, etc)
- ensure your `~/.chutes/config.ini` file is present on the machine (generated automatically when you register with chutes)
- install docker and chutes 
- generate the python script containing your chute called "my_chute.py" via `bb -v generate-chute-script --revision your-hf-sha`
- run `chutes build my_chute:chute --local --public`
- `docker images`
- run the image you just built and enter it `docker run -p 8000:8000 -it <image-name> /bin/bash` 
- when inside the container: `export CHUTES_EXECUTION_CONTEXT=REMOTE` and run `chutes run my_chute:chute --dev --debug`
- query the endpoints from outside the container

5. Push the model to your miner
Once you are happy with the changes, push your model to Huggingface Hub and then deploy it to Chutes and onto Bittensor with the following command:

```bash
bb -vv push --model-path <i.e. ./my_model>
```

Note the HuggingFace repo revision and chute slug from the logs. If you missed it you can get the revision directly from your HF account and you can use this to get your chute-slug and ID:
```bash
bb -v chute-slug --revision your-huggingface-repo-sha
```

(Be careful, you only have a limited number of uploads per 24hours)

6. Test it live
Soon your model will be hot on chutes. You can check that using 
```bash
chutes chutes list
```

You can test the /health and /predict endpoints using a fake challenge payload like so:

```bash 
bb -v ping-chute --revision your-huggingface-repo-sha
``` 


If you are finding problems with your live chute, you can view its logs like so:
- log into chutes via the browser (use your fingerprint)
- find the chute "My Chutes"
- go to the "Statistics" tab
- note down the instance-id
- query the logs via the api: `curl -XGET https://api.chutes.ai/instances/<CHUTE-INSTANCE-ID>/logs -H "Authorization: <CHUTES-API-KEY>"`

1. Delete old models (optional)
You can remove an old version of your model from chutes if desired
```bash
bb -v delete-chute --revision your-old-huggingface-repo-sha 
```

## Option 2: Self-Hosted Miner (Development/Testing)

For local development and testing, you can run a miner directly on your hardware without using Chutes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10-3.13
- Sufficient RAM/VRAM for your chosen model
- For Mac: Models run on CPU by default (or MPS for Apple Silicon)

### Setup

1. **Configure your miner settings in `.env`:**

```bash
# Device configuration
MINER_DEVICE=cpu              # Use 'cpu', 'cuda' (NVIDIA), or 'mps' (Apple Silicon)
MINER_MODEL_ID=gpt2           # Start with gpt2 for testing, upgrade for production
MINER_AXON_PORT=8091          # Port for the miner API
MINER_LOAD_IN_8BIT=0          # Enable 8-bit quantization (requires bitsandbytes)
MINER_LOAD_IN_4BIT=0          # Enable 4-bit quantization (requires bitsandbytes)
MINER_EXTERNAL_IP=your-public-ip  # Optional: override public IP for axon registration
```

**Model recommendations:**
- **Testing**: `gpt2` or `distilgpt2` (small, fast on CPU)
- **Production**: `meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B` or larger (requires GPU)

2. **Register your miner's axon on-chain:**

```bash
uv run python babelbit/miner/register_axon.py
```

This registers your miner's IP and port with the Bittensor network so validators can find you.
Note: this is only required for self-hosted miners. If you have a chute commitment, validators will use the chute and will not call the axon.

3. **Start the miner server:**

```bash
uv run babelbit/miner/serve_miner.py
```

The server will:
- Load your model (first run may take time to download)
- Start serving on the configured port (default: 8091)
- Expose `/healthz` and `/predict` endpoints

4. **Test your miner API:**

```bash
uv run babelbit/miner/tests/test_miner_api.py
```

This verifies both the health endpoint and prediction functionality.
For local testing (no Bittensor headers), start the server in dev mode first:

```bash
MINER_DEV_MODE=1 uv run babelbit/miner/serve_miner.py
```

### Performance Tips

**For Mac users:**
- GPT-2 works well on CPU (inference ~2-5 seconds)
- Larger models (Llama, etc.) are very slow on CPU (60-120 seconds)
- MPS (Apple Silicon GPU) has compatibility issues with some models

**For GPU users:**
- Set `MINER_DEVICE=cuda`
- Use larger models for better predictions
- Enable quantization to reduce VRAM usage

**Memory optimization:**
- Enable 8-bit quantization: `MINER_LOAD_IN_8BIT=1`
- Enable 4-bit quantization: `MINER_LOAD_IN_4BIT=1` (even more memory savings)

### Troubleshooting

**"Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled"**
- You're on Mac or don't have a GPU - set `MINER_DEVICE=cpu`

**"Placeholder storage has not been allocated on MPS device"**
- MPS has issues with some models - use `MINER_DEVICE=cpu` instead

**Predictions timeout**
- Your model is too large for CPU - try `MINER_MODEL_ID=gpt2`
- Or enable quantization to speed up inference

**Model download fails**
- For gated models (Llama, etc.), set `HF_TOKEN` environment variable
- Check your HuggingFace access permissions
